# NEO Compiler for .NET with Debugger Enhancements (neon-de)

This branch contains a fork of the NEO 2 version of NEO Compiler for .NET
(aka NEON). This fork generates debugger information needed by the
[NEO Smart Contract Debugger](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-debugger).

The changes in this branch will eventually be merged into the official release
of NEON for both NEO 2 and NEO 3. Additionally, the debug information generated
by NEON-DE we be improved, documented and standardized in order for other NEO
smart contract compilers such as [neo-boa](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-boa)
can generate it.
